# MVC-web-application-using-azure-storage

This is an MVC Web application from where you can upload and delete images inside the Azure Blob storage. 
We use LINQ model in order to save or delete our uploads in our database and get the list of images that we have upload.
As for the Azure Blob storage operations we use the local windows azure emulator.

For testing after the default path add "/Home/Upload"
